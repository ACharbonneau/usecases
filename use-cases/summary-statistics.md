**Persona:** [Data Custodian](../personas/data-custodian).

**Objective:** [Monitor Data Releases](../objectives/single-dcc-release)

### Monitor Data Releases as a Data Custodian
Janice is the PI for data coordinating center. She would like
to use the CFDE dashboard to help write a progress report for her funding agency.
Using the browse and filter functions on the CFDE portal she creates a report
containing relevant summary statistics for datasets owned by her DCC, and
rendered graphs and figures of the summary data. This includes information such
as how much data is currently publicly available on her portal, how much is
uploaded but embargoed, the FAIRness score for these datasets, and how these
statistics have changed over the previous year.
