## Overview

A Use Case consists of an **Objective** and a **Persona** - 
a person who can have an objective. These are combined into a **summary**
of specific use for the CFDE, which can be achieved by a series 
of **user narratives**. Each narrative is enabled by a
set of **user stories**, which are technically-focused details about
how to achieve that narrative. User stories will often be shared among
different narratives.

## Definitions

### Objective

A description of a scientific process, told
without reference to a specific technology solution. Focuses on
resources required, method(s) followed, and outcome(s) targeted. Can
be validated with scientific stakeholders.

###  Persona 
A type of user who will appear in the epics and stories that follow.

###   User Focused Summary
A high-level, non-technical description of an entire Use Case. The user in each summary has a name, a scientific or administrative problem, and both proximate and ultimate goals. The focus is on the problem and what is generally needed to solve it.

###   Technical Summary
A more technical summary of the Use Case. Like the Scientific Summary, the user has a name, a scientific problem and goals, however here there is more detail about the specific tasks and less focus on the scientific relevance.

###   User Narrative
A story, told from the user's perspective that captures a
valuable set of interactions with tools (e.g. software solutions) in
the service of achieving the scientific objective. Must be written in
terms that are meaningful to the user, preferably from their
perspective. This can be thought of as one in a series of medium scale tasks that must be completed to
answer the question posed in the scientific objective. It should include mentions of everything the user needs to
achieve their goal, even interactions that don't involve the software
or data from the Common Fund. 

###   User Story
A specific piece of a User Narrative that translates to a
well-scoped and defined piece of software or data engineering
work. These should be small tasks that can be verified with engineering teams (Did we deliver it? Yes
or no.) A collection of user stories can be grouped to complete a larger task in a User Narrative. Certain stories are likely to appear in multiple epics and should not be duplicated if possible.
