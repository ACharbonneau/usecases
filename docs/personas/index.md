# Persona

A generalized type of user. Each persona will have a title, and a short description of their abilities and background. 
Some personas may additionally have 'Assumptions', which are characteristics of the persona that might influence the
requirements of a use case. For instance, some user types are assumed to have log-in credentials that will change what
data is available to them.
