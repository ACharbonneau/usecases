# Requirements

A requirement is a well-scoped and defined piece of software or data engineering work that is needed to support a User Task. These should be small tasks that can be verified with engineering teams (Did we deliver it? Yes or no.) A single requirement might be important for any number of different User Tasks, and various collections of Requirements can be grouped to support different User Tasks.
