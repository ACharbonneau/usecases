# Use Cases

A **Use Case** consists of an **Objective** and a **Persona** -
a person who can have an **Objective**. These are combined into a **summary**
of specific use for the CFDE, which can be achieved by a series
of **user tasks**. Each **User Task** is single step in the users workflow.
The technical infrastucture required
to enable a **User Task** are it's **Requirements**. In most cases, what
appears to the user as a single step actually is a multistep process to the
computer doing the work, so any given **User Task** will likely have many **Requirements**.
Both **user tasks** and **requirements** can be shared across **Use Cases**
