# User Task

A user task is a story, told from the user's perspective that captures a concrete step in a users interactions with tools (e.g. software solutions) in the service of achieving the scientific objective. Must be written in terms that are meaningful to the user, from their perspective. This can be thought of as one in a series of medium scale tasks that must be completed to answer the question posed in the scientific objective. The list of User Tasks in a Use Case should cover everything the user needs to achieve their goal, even interactions that don't involve the software or data from the Common Fund.
