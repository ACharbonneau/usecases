### Power User Summary
Lacey is a computational post-doc who has preliminary results indicating that GeneX is implicated in Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD).

Upon looking into Kids First and HubMAP, Lacey notes that both provide access to their data through Cavatica. As she is not familiar with Cavatica, she finds CFDE-developed training materials and uses those to familiarize herself with accessing and analyzing data through Cavatica’s API. She then queries single cell RNA-seq data from HubMAP through Cavatica’s API and identifies three genes co-expressed with GeneX in Cajal–Retzius cells. She verifies this expression pattern by viewing ISH and IHC data for the four genes of interest on the HuBMAP website, which was available via a link from the HuBMAP summary information on the CFDE portal. Lacey then accesses Kids First variant call files through Cavatica and runs a candidate gene association to determine if GeneX or any of the co-expressed genes are associated with FCD. She finds a weak association between FCD and GeneX as well as two of the genes co-expressed in Cajal–Retzius cells. Lacey creates several figures summarizing her findings which Pam uses as preliminary data to support her next grant.
