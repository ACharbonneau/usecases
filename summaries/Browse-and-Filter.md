### Browsing and Filtering
Pam wants to use the CFDE portal to access datasets owned by different DCCs and filter down to the results that will be relevant to her biological question. She is a postdoc working in a lab that studies the thyroid, and she plans to collaborate with a computational biologist to analyze datasets from a variety of studies for evidence of an association with thyroid disorders. She would like to use the CFDE portal to browse and filter metadata and summary statistics for datasets in order to find suitable studies for her analysis. She would like to see summary metadata and quickly download automatically rendered plots she can use in a PowerPoint presentation she is planning to prepare for the next lab meeting. She also wants to download a table containing both the summarized metadata and the names of the associated files which can be shared with her collaborator, and be sure that they uses exactly the same files she has selected.
