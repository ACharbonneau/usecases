**Persona:** [Clinical Researcher](../personas/clinical-researcher).

**Objective:** [Multiple DCC Comparison](../objectives/multi-dcc-comparison)


Pams table of the summarized metadata and summary statistics (e.g., relevant
studies, data types, number of participants, diagnoses) from each dataset as
well as the names and locations of the corresponding files.

Pam provides Lacey with the results of an initial CFDE search she performed that identified datasets which include information related to FCD. The search results
had identified two CFDE programs with clinical data related to FCD: Kids First
and HubMAP. HubMAP additionally includes genomics data, which can be used to
better understand the mechanism by which GeneX influences FCD, and Kids First
includes genetic information allowing Lacey to attempt to replicate Pamâ€™s
earlier findings in a new cohort.
