**Persona:** [Clinical Researcher](../personas/clinical-researcher).

**Objective:** [Multiple DCC Comparison](../objectives/multi-dcc-comparison)


Pams wants to build a table of the summarized metadata and summary statistics (e.g., relevant studies, data types, number of participants, diagnoses) from each dataset
in the Common Fund that relate to Focal Cortical Dysplasia.

Pam searches by anatomical site, and then filters the results to those studies
that collected 'age of onset', 'sex' and 'location' as metadata, and that used
RNASeq. The search results had identified two CFDE programs with clinical data
related to FCD: Kids First and HubMAP. HubMAP additionally includes genomics data,
which can be used to better understand the mechanism by which Pam's gene of
interest influences FCD, and Kids First includes genetic information that might
be useful for replicating Pamâ€™s earlier findings in a new cohort.

Pam uses the results to start a dbGaP access request for her lab. She also sends
her final table to her postdoc, Lacey, who will do the actual analysis.
