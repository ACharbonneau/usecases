### Discover datasets relevant to a hypothesis
George is a clinical researcher at a children's hospital. His patients often have
rare and idiosyncratic diseases, and it is difficult or impossible to find a
large enough disease cohort for traditional study. However, George now has a handful
of patients with some overlapping liver symptoms, and he wants to see what
data is already available that might apply to his patients.

George has come to the CFDE portal to search for all available data on liver
tissues. His goal is to determine what DCCs have experimental data on both disease
and normal liver, so he can do a more through search at those DCC sites.

By filtering on anatomical terms, George found metabolomic data and histopathic images from various liver samples, as well as several types of
sequencing data from three different DCCs. Using the provided links, he scans
these dataset descriptions to find ones that closely match his needs.
