### Discover datasets relevant to a hypothesis
George is a clinical researcher at a children's hospital. His patients often have
rare and idiosyncratic diseases, and it is difficult or impossible to find a
large enough disease cohort for traditional study. However, George now has a handful
of patients with some overlapping liver symptoms, and he is considering doing exome
sequencing to look for genetic similarities.

George has come to the CFDE portal to search for all available data on liver
tissues. His goal is to determine what DCCs have experimental data on both disease
and normal liver, so he can do a more through search at those DCC sites.

Through this process, George found metabolomic data and histopathic images from
individuals with similar symptoms



, and he wants to apply for a
Kids First X01 sequencing grant to look for genetic similarities. However, he's
not sure what sequencing method (RNA? exome? genome?) would be most likely
to be useful.
