### Discover datasets relevant to a hypothesis
George is a clinical researcher at a children's hospital. His patients often have
rare and idiosyncratic diseases, and it is difficult or impossible to find a
large enough disease cohort for traditional study. However, George now has a handful
of patients with some overlapping liver symptoms, and he is interested in seeing what
data already exists that might inform his work.

George has come to the CFDE portal to search for all available data on liver
tissues. His goal is to determine what DCCs have experimental data on both disease
and normal liver, so he can do a more through search at those DCC sites.

By filtering on anatomy terms, George finds metabolomic data and histopathic images from
individuals with similar symptoms, as well as sequencing data from several DCCs.
