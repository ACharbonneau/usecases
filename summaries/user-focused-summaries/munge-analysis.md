Pam wants to use the CFDE portal to access datasets owned by different DCCs and filter down to the RNA-Seq files from both healthy and diseased thyroid tissue, to compare to the RNA-Seq results she has from her patient with an as-of-yet unidentified thyroid disorder. She plans to send her data list to a computational analyst for analysis. She would like to use the CFDE portal to browse and filter data by tissue, sequencing strategy, and disease state. She wants to view summary statistics for each of the studies in her list, including the DCC steward, study size, information about the sequencer, whether the data is restricted, and what consent form was used. After further filtering by these parameters, she would like to download a table of her results to send to her computational analyst. This table should have unique IDs so that her analyst can be sure they have gotten exactly the data that Pam chose.
download automatically rendered plots she can use in a PowerPoint presentation she is planning to prepare for the next lab meeting. She also wants to download a table containing both the summarized metadata and the names of the associated files which can be shared with her collaborator, and be sure that they uses exactly the same files she has selected.
