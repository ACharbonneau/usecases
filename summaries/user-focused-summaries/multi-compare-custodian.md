### Explore data availability to build policy
Betsy is a leader at the Common Fund, and wants to build summary tables of
Common Fund assets for use in both tracking progress and for finding gaps that
should be filled by future initiatives. She would like to use the CFDE dashboard
to download simple tables or graphs that show what assets exist, and where.

Using a web browser, Betsy uses a point and click interface to get a matrix of
Uberon tissue terms by DCC. With a few more clicks, she gets similar tables showing
Species, Experiment Types, and Diseases by DCC.

Since these are simple binary matrices, Betsy can plot the data in almost any
piece of plotting software. Since she would like to see what terms are most broadly
and most infrequently found in the Common Fund, she opts for using UpSet, which
will automatically render her data in a type of multidimensional venn diagram.
