# Use Cases



## Style Guide

- Adding new use cases and editing existing files:
  - If you are adding new use case files and making changes to existing pages that link them, create one pull request so the changes can all be checked before being pushed to the `master` branch.
  - The index is automatically created by yaml headers. As long as the correct parent of the new files is specified, the index will be automatically added to the correct index page.
