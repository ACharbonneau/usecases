This user understands computation, and is comfortable with the command line interface (CLI) and at least one other programming language, however they are not experts in biology. 

They will primarily interact with the data using an API, and will expect that the data is in a form that can be used by workflow languages. They will rarely work in a point and click interface here, however they will likely be receiving lists of data files to analyze that their less computational colleagues created using the GUI.
