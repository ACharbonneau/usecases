### Data Custodian

This user has a vested interest in making sure their data is available, widely used, and used appropriately. They are concerned both that their data is being used within the confines of its use policy, and also that users are making sound statistical and biological inferences with it. They have a deep knowledge of their dataset and how it can and canâ€™t be used to answer questions; however, their computational knowledge may range from novice to professional bioinformatician.
